1)Goals of program:
- a)Schedule meals
- b)Compile shopping list based on recipe used

2)Secondary goals:

- b)Keep track of calorie counts
- c)Track stats on meal spending, frequencies of meals/recipes used
- d)Public sharing of recipes
- e)Recipe manipulation
  - 1) Rating
  - 2) Changes to the recipe

3)Tertiary goals:
- a) Compile recommended meals based on calories/cost

4)How:
- 2b:
    1) Record costs of each item
      - use averages of input to compute estimate
      - use highest price to compute worst-case
      - use lowest price to compute best-case

    2) Dynamic cost checker?
      - Is there a reliable website to have the program reference?
